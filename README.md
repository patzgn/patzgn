# Hi, my name is Patrycja ðŸ‘‹

I am a structural engineer with a deep passion for programming and software development. In addition to my work as an engineer, I am also developing tools and applications to support the design process, with a focus on efficiency and accuracy.

In my free time, I am always eager to learn more about programming. I am currently focused on learning :white_medium_small_square:**Java**:white_medium_small_square: and :white_medium_small_square:**Spring**:white_medium_small_square: and I am excited to continue delving deeper into these technologies.

### Autodesk Revit extensions
I have developed multiple Autodesk Revit extensions using Revit API, PyRevit, and Python. These extensions have not only improved documentation quality but have also saved a considerable amount of time. As an example, one of the extensions I have created is for automating reinforcement modeling in Revit. With this extension, you can automate the process of creating reinforcement for concrete elements such as walls, columns, and slabs. Simply specify the desired reinforcement parameters, select the elements you want to reinforce, and let the extension do the rest.
