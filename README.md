# Hi, my name is Patrycja ðŸ‘‹

I am a structural engineer with a deep passion for programming and software development. In addition to my work as an engineer, I am also developing tools and applications to support the design process, with a focus on efficiency and accuracy.

In my free time, I am always eager to learn more about programming. I am currently focused on learning :white_medium_small_square:**Java**:white_medium_small_square: and :white_medium_small_square:**Spring**:white_medium_small_square: and I am excited to continue delving deeper into these technologies.

## :star: My top projects outside this repository

### Autodesk Revit extensions
I have developed multiple Autodesk Revit extensions using Revit API, PyRevit, and Python. These extensions have not only improved documentation quality but have also saved a considerable amount of time. As an example, one of the extensions I have created is for automating reinforcement modeling in Revit. With this extension, you can automate the process of creating reinforcement for concrete elements such as walls, columns, and slabs. Simply specify the desired reinforcement parameters, select the elements you want to reinforce, and let the extension do the rest.

### Tekla Structures - Box girder bridge reinforcement

This extension automates the process of generating a detailed reinforcement model for the bridge segment. The script typically begins by extracting the necessary geometry from the Tekla Structures model and design data from the Excel file. It then uses this data to create a 3D reinforcement model, showing the exact location, size, and orientation of each reinforcement bar.

By automating the reinforcement modeling process, the script can significantly reduce the time and effort required to produce an accurate and detailed reinforcement model for a box girder bridge. This allows designers and engineers to focus on other aspects of the project, such as analysis and optimization, ultimately improving project efficiency and reducing errors.

### Tekla Structures - Drawing Register

A drawing register is a document that contains a list of all the drawings associated with a construction project, along with relevant details such as the drawing number, revision number and title. The Excel file is linked to Tekla Structures through a custom program, which extracts the necessary data from the model and populates the register. This also enables easy filtering and sorting of the data, making it easier to manage and track the project's drawings.

### DesignCheck

DesignCheck is a library of engineering calculations. Calculations written using DesingCheck provide a line-by-line report output so that any engineer, no matter their programming knowledge, can see how the answers were arrived at. As well as being easy to check DesignCheck calculations can be integrated into any engineering workflow, wheter that's traditional or automated.
